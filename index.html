      <li> Hand of God (1986) - At the 1986 FIFA World Cup Final between Argentina and England, Maradona scored from an aerial ball with his hand. As his hand was obstructed from the view of the referee with his head, the goal was given and Argentina was crowned champions. The goal has remained a topic of controversy in the football world today. </li>
